# Seed plant classifier

This Computer vision learner (CNN) helps to automatically classify seed plants. All these Spermatophytes are classified by different divisions (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatophyte). 
The concept of this code is based on lesson 2 of the fast.ai library v3 (see: https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/lesson2-download.ipynb)
